# 🌡️ Exploring Temperature Trends in India

India, known for its climatic diversity, has experienced noticeable temperature shifts over the years. With climate change becoming an increasingly pressing issue, this project aims to explore historical temperature data to uncover patterns, analyze correlations, and predict future trends.

This notebook walks through a complete data science workflow — from loading and cleaning the data to performing exploratory data analysis and building a simple predictive model.

## 📈 Summary

- Analyzed India's historical temperature data to identify long-term trends.
- Observed a gradual rise in annual temperatures, suggesting warming patterns.
- Performed correlation analysis to study inter-month temperature relationships using a masked heatmap for clarity.
- Developed a basic predictive model to estimate future temperature trends.
- Evaluated model performance using Mean Squared Error and R² metrics.

## 🔮 Future Work

This project lays the groundwork for deeper climate analysis in India. Future improvements could include:

- Applying advanced time series models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM)
- Incorporating external factors like CO₂ emissions or rainfall data
- Visualizing regional temperature differences within India
